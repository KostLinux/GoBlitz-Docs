GoBlitz supports session based authentication. The session based authentication is a way to authenticate users by storing the user's session information on the server. The session information is stored in the server's memory or in a database. The session information is stored in a cookie on the client side. The session information is used to authenticate the user on GoBlitz API Paths.
